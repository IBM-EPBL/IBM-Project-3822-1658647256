SmartFarmer IOT Enabled Smart Farming ApplicationðŸŒ´

ðŸš€TECHNOLOGY : INTERNET OF THINGS

ðŸš€TEAM ID : PNT2022TMID26062

ðŸŒ¾ PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This smart agriculture using IOT system is powered by Arduino, it consists of Temperature sensor, Moisture sensor, water level sensor, DC motor and GPRS module. When the IOT based agriculture monitoring system starts it checks the water level, humidity and moisture level
IoT smart farming solutions is a system that is built for monitoring the crop field with the help of sensors (light, humidity, temperature, soil moisture, crop health, etc.) and automating the irrigation system. The farmers can monitor the field conditions from anywhere.
PROJECT DESIGN AND PLANNING:
We usually creat MIT app which is used to connect with clode to fetch real time information
and also with help of firebase and nodered we optain real time temperature
,humidity ,weather and moter on off for water pouring in agniculture
## Technology Stack
Python Golang JavaScript

Django Flask
